        <p>The war of independence is a glorious period in the history of our country. The war was fought against the Pakistan army in 1971. Through this war, Bangladesh emerged as an independent country. It was also a war of supreme sacrifice. About three million people died in this war, Most of them died in the genocide carried out by the Pakistani army. On March 25, the army launched a massive attack in which there were heavy casualties. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib was arrested and flown to West Pakistan. Before that, he declared the independence of Bangladesh. Most of the Awami League leaders fled and set up a government-in-exile in Calcutta, declaring Bangladesh an independent state. Internal resistance was mobilized by some Bengali units of the regular army, notably by Major Zia ur-Rahman. Eventually, on Dec. 3, 1971, the Indian army invaded the territory of its neighbor. The Pakistani army surrendered on December 16. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was released from jail and returned to a heroâ€™s welcome, assuming leadership of the new Bangladesh government in January 1972. Our victory in the war of independence was a hard-earned one. We should not let this great achievement go in vain.</p>
